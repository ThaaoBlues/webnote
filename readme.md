Litte markdown note taking and drawing website, made in 30s using mistral+chatgpt. The goal is to use it when I want to quicly insert sketches in my markdown files or just to take quick notes in class.

TOUDOU :
- shapes toolbox
- connect an svg marketplace to import cool drawings available on internet
- ability to import svg files
